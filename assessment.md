title: Assessment
---

The assessment will be in form of miniprojects. Each project will be undertaken in a team of two. Work starts in Week 6, and continues across to Week 8.

The teams will each work on a shared code base, and document their decision making through pull requests and issue logs. 

Final submission will be in the form of a colab notebook alongside a github repository.
