Estimate the working set of each layer of MobileNetv2 and provide it as a table assuming only inference is performed. In the MobileNetv2 paper linked above, you will find Table 2 provides a detailed description of each layer of the model, please base your answer on this specification. You can compute this by hand, or you could specify the architecture in pytorch and use a function like [modelsummary](https://pypi.org/project/pytorch-model-summary/) to help you. Include a brief explaination as to how you calculated the values for your table. *Please remember the working set memory of each layer will be larger than just the weight parameters alone.*\n",
